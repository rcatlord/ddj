## Learning objectives

  - familiarity with main dplyr functions  
  - confident downloading and cleaning Government data  
  - conduct simple exploratory data analysis

## Data

Weâ€™ll be exploring local area cycling rates in England. The [Active
Lives
Survey](https://www.sportengland.org/research-and-data/data/active-lives)
conducted by Sport England estimates the proportion of adults that cycle
by local authority by frequency and purpose (travel and leisure). The
[data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/walking-and-cycling-statistics-cw)
(Table CW0302) are available to download from the Department of
Transport and cover November 2015 to November 2021.

6.  What percentage of local authorities observed a drop in the
    proportion of adults cycling at least once a week for any purpose in
    2021 compared with before the pandemic?

7.  How does the proportion of adults cycling at least once a week in
    England differ by purpose between 2021 and 2020?
